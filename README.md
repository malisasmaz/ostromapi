# TechStack
I use TypeScript Express.js and TypeORM to craete REST API.

1. I used TypeORM because, it is a great option for database processes. TypeORM is an ORM that can run on NodeJS, React Native, etc. Its is support the latest JavaScript features and provide additional features that help you to develop any kind of application that uses databases.

2. I used MongoDb Atlas on database side. It is free version, cloud based and online. Better than local options.

3. I used Express js for API operations. It is most starred npm package and great option for building API :).
